# TypeScript

TypeScript is a **typed superset of JavaScript** developed by Microsoft. It adds **static typing** to JavaScript, allowing developers to catch errors at compile time instead of runtime. TypeScript enhances the development process by providing better tooling, autocomplete, and error detection.

## What This Repository Demonstrates

The `index.ts` file in this repository showcases the following core TypeScript concepts:

### 1. **Console Logging**
- Prints messages and values to the console using `console.log()`.

### 2. **Variable Declarations & Type Assignments**
- Declares variables with specific types (`number`, `string`, `boolean`).
- Demonstrates implicit and explicit type assignments.

### 3. **Updating Variables**
- Shows how to update the values of variables after their initial declaration.

### 4. **Working with `null` and `undefined`**
- Demonstrates how to assign `null` and `undefined` values to variables and log them.

### 5. **Arrays**
- Declares arrays with strings, numbers, and even **2D arrays**.
- Shows how to access array elements and log them.

### 6. **Array Methods**
- Uses `.push()` to add new elements to arrays.

### 7. **Type Inference in Arrays**
- TypeScript automatically infers the types of arrays based on the initial values provided.

### 8. **Mixed-Type Arrays**
- Demonstrates how to create arrays with multiple data types, showing TypeScript's ability to handle various types in a single array.

### üìù Union Types in TypeScript
- A union type in TypeScript allows a variable to hold values of multiple different types. It is defined using the | (pipe) symbol, which means "or". This gives you the flexibility to assign a value to a variable that can be one of several types.

### üìù Any Types in TypeScript
- The any type is a powerful feature in TypeScript that allows a variable to hold values of any type, and it essentially disables type checking for that variable.
